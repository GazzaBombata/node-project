# Node-Project Backend

This is the backend for the Node-Project. It's built with Node.js, Express, and Sequelize, and uses Babel for ES6 support.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Installing

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GazzaBombata/node-project.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd node-project`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

### Building the Application

This application uses Babel to transpile ES6 code. To build the application, run: `npm run build`

This will transpile the code in the `src` directory and output it to the `dist` directory.

### Running the Application

To start the server, run: `npm start`

The server will start on `localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your environment variables).

The application, thanks to GCP App Engine, is also hosted online at the link https://node-project-411013.oa.r.appspot.com/. 

The Database is hosted on Google Cloud SQL Servers.
